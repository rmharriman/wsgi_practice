uWSGI and NGINX:
Need to install uwsgi-plugin-python3
socket permissions then need to be set to 777 (need to figure out better way to do this)
Uwsgi command:
uwsgi -s /tmp/app.sock --manage-script-name --mount /=wsgi_app_v2:app --plugin python3

Nginx config (modified these lines in the default sites-enabled config (/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default:

 #root /var/www/html;

# Serve app at root and pass all requests to the uwsgi socket
location / {
        try_files $uri @app;
}

location @app {
        include uwsgi_params;
        uwsgi_pass unix:/tmp/app.sock;
}


Gunicorn and nginx:
/usr/local/bin/gunicorn wsgi_app_v2:app

nginx proxy pass used (changed default sites-enabled config):
location / {
                include proxy_params;
                proxy_pass http://localhost:8000;
        }

Gevent (also used proxy pass - port 5000 this time):
Need only add a gevent server file and run it:
from gevent.wsgi import WSGIServer
from wsgi_app_v2 import app

http_server = WSGIServer(('', 5000), app)
http_server.serve_forever()

mod_wsgi:
Place a config file in the apache sites-enabled directory to tell apache about the wsgi app
Sample:
<VirtualHost *:80>

    WSGIDaemonProcess yourapplication user=rmharriman group=rmharriman threads=5
    WSGIScriptAlias / /var/www/html/cgi-bin/app.wsgi

    <Directory /var/www/html/cgi-bin>
        WSGIProcessGroup yourapplication
        WSGIApplicationGroup %{GLOBAL}
        Require all granted
    </Directory>
</VirtualHost>

Create a wsgi file that receives calls (mapped above in the script alias):
# Need to make sure instance of application is called application
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, '/var/www/html/cgi-bin')

from wsgi_app_v2 import app as application
